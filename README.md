# UOW Projects
Collection of the different exercises and assignments from my semester at the University of Wollongong

### Projects
The projects are sorted by subjects. And then project names.
In every project directory there is a folder called 'Assignment'. This is where the assignment we were given will be.

### Languages
I had introduction to basic programming in Python my first two semesters of University, then introduction to object-oriented programming in Java the next two semesters. I don't have any experience with C++.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
For the assignments in Algorithms and Data Structures, I have chosen to do these programs first in Java (The ones I submit to school will mostly be Java), then I try to do them in Python and C++ if I have time for it. I am doing it this way to learn more about the differences in the languages and hopefully I will be able to keep it up during the semester.
