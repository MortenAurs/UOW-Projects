# UOW Projects
Collection of the different exercises and assignments from my semester at the University of Wollongong

### Projects
The projects are sorted by subjects. And then project names.
In most of the project directories there should be a folder called 'Assignment' where there is a .pdf of the assignment we got.

### Languages
I had introduction to basic programming in Python my first two semesters of University, then introduction to object-oriented programming in Java the next two semesters. I don't have any previous experience with C++.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
For the assignments in Algorithms and Data Structures, I tried to do the assignments in Java first, then Python and C++, but it was a little bit too time consuming, so I will stick to Java while the semester is ongoing. When I have more time I will try translate the assignments into Python and/or C++ for learning purposes.
