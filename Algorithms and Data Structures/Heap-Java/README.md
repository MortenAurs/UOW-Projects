### Heap-Java

## How to run program:
Assuming you have cloned the repo, cd into ~/Heap-Java/src
and run the command 'java ex2'.
You will then be prompted to enter the name of the text file, which is 'ex2.txt'.

## What is happening?
The ex2.txt file contains about 100 numbers in a random order.
The program is inserting all of these numbers into a heap-list, first based on a minimum number(in this case 14) , then it takes the heap list it created and creates a new heap list based on the maximum number(in this case 963).
